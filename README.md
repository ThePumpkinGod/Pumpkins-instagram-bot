# Story: Why is this a thing?

The story began in October 2019, when a friend of mine challenged me to create an Instagram bot.  
I answered no.  
THE END  
...  

Ok just kidding, I didn't want to work on it firstly,  
but after seeing companies selling bots like this one for 15$/m, I've decided to make my own bot and release it for free.

I've set a few rules for this project:  

1. Everything is free forever.  
2. The project will stay open source.  
3. No Ads.  
4. Data is saved on a server, your PC only.  
5. Simple UI for everyone.  
6. No automatic updates.
